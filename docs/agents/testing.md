# Testing Notes

## Live web smoke

The live web platform smoke runs the public built CLI against a local fixture page through the managed web backend:

```bash
AGENT_DEVICE_WEB_E2E=1 pnpm test:smoke:web
```

The test is skipped unless `AGENT_DEVICE_WEB_E2E=1` is set. The test runs `agent-device web setup` and `agent-device web doctor` with an isolated state directory before opening the fixture URL, so it verifies the public managed-backend setup path instead of relying on a global `agent-browser`. CI runs the lane on Node 24 because the managed backend requires Node >= 24. Failure artifacts, daemon state, and browser config are written under `test/artifacts/web/`.

## Speed rules (experiment-backed, 2026-07-04)

Measured on the full unit suite (340 files, 3,210 tests, 48s wall at ~7x parallelism):

- **Wall clock equals the slowest file.** The 44.6s android monolith bounded the whole 48s run
  (Amdahl at file granularity: vitest parallelizes per file). Splitting monolith test files is a
  wall-clock optimization, not just a navigation one — see the AGENTS.md test-topology mirror rule.
- **Unit tests must not wait real time.** The suite's worst tests slept through production budgets:
  10.8s to prove "times out" by waiting out the full constant, 8s emulator-boot polls at 1Hz, real
  retry backoffs. Conversion patterns, in preference order (tracking issue #1098):
  1. *Budget-derived cadence* (production-legit): poll intervals scale with the caller's timeout —
     this took `devices.test.ts` from 25.6s to 2.8s (9x) while making short-budget production calls
     more responsive.
  2. *Budget-wiring assertion*: don't re-prove the exec layer's timeout per call site; mock the tool
     layer and assert the right `timeoutMs` constant is passed. Exec-layer timeout semantics are
     proven once, in exec's own tests.
  3. *Fake clocks* where the code accepts an injected clock.
  Never add a test-only DI seam for this — the CI gate forbids it; patterns 1–2 are production
  improvements and test restructurings respectively.
- **The slow-test ratchet** (`scripts/vitest-slow-test-reporter.ts`) enforces this: unit budget
  2.5s, integration 15s, failure at 2x budget (the band between reports without failing — host
  load legitimately stretches borderline tests, and a flaky gate trains people to ignore it).
  The pin list only shrinks, or grows in the same PR with a justification.
- **Isolation stays ON; pool stays forks — both measured.** `--no-isolate`: 205s wall vs 48s
  (module state — timers, memos, singletons — thrashes across files sharing a worker).
  `--pool=threads`: no change (50.4s). The ~100s aggregate import overhead is the price of
  isolation and is paid in parallel; reduce it per file by importing the module under test, not
  platform barrels.
